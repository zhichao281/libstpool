 *
 *    1. Every group has its own priority queue. 
 *       (see @ref stpool_create for details about the priority queue)
 *
 *    2. Every task can only be added into one group of the pool at the same time.
 *
 *    3. The task should not change its group id casually if it has not been done completely.
 *
 *    4. the pool's taskScheduler will peek some tasks from the groups and delive 
 *    	 them into the threadManager to execute.
 *
 *         .Only tasks from ACTIVE groups will be peeked by the taskScheduler
 *
 *         .If there are multiple ACTIVE groups at the same time, taskScheduler will
 *          choose the best task according to the groups' configurations, the tasks'
 *          scheduling attribute (priority, policy, added_time), etc, and then pass 
 *          it to the threadManager.
 *
 *         .If the paralle tasks number of the group has arrived at the limits, the 
 *          scheduler will stop scheduling this group even if the priority of top task
 *          existing in this group's queue is hightest in the pool, in this situation, 
 *          the Scheduler will scan the other groups whose paralle tasks number has not
 *          arrived at the limits and choose a best task to execute, and if none tasks
 *          have been peeked by the scheduler, the scheduler will scan the groups again
 *          to choose the best task from the groups whose \@receive_benifits is none zero
 *         
 *         .the only duty of the threadManager is to provide the best services for
 *           the ready tasks.
 *
 *    5. the pool has a global dispatching queue, all of the removed tasks from the 
 *      groups will be pushed into it, and the pool will determine when to dispatch
 *      their completion callback. (Actually, the removed tasks are always be peeked
 *      prior to the normal tasks by the scheduler)
 *
 *    (In fact, the threadManager does not exist, I present it to users is to make
 *     the APIs of the library easier to be used by users)
